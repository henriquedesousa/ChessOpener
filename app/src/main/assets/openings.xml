            <p>The Sicilian is the most popular and best-scoring response to White's first move
                1.e4. 1.d4 is a statistically more successful opening for white due to the high
                success rate of the Sicilian defence against 1.e4.

                attributes the Sicilian Defence's popularity to "its combative nature; in many lines
                Black is playing not just for equality, but for the advantage. The drawback is that
                White often obtains an early initiative, so Black has to take care not to fall
                victim to a quick attack."

                considered why the Sicilian is the most successful response to 1.e4, even though
                1...c5 develops no pieces, and the pawn on c5 controls only d4 and b4. Rowson
                writes:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="templatequote">
                <p>To my mind there is quite a straightforward explanation. In order to profit from
                    the initiative granted by the first move, White has to make use of his
                    opportunity to do something before Black has an equal number of opportunities of
                    his own. However, to do this, he has to make 'contact' with the black position.
                    The first point of contact usually comes in the form of a pawn exchange, which
                    leads to the opening of the position. … So the thought behind 1...c5 is this:
                    ″OK, I'll let you open the position, and develop your pieces aggressively, but
                    at a price – you have to give me one of your center pawns.″

            <p>The Blackmar–Diemer Gambit arose as a development of the earlier Blackmar Gambit,
                named after
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armand_Blackmar" title="Armand Blackmar">
                    Armand Blackmar</a>, a relatively
                little-known New Orleans player of the late 19th century who popularized its
                characteristic
                moves (1.d4 d5 2.e4 dxe4 3.f3) and was the first player to publish analysis on the
                opening
                in the chess literature.

                The popularity of the original Blackmar Gambit, however, was short-lived, as it was
                basically unsound, allowing Black to secure a superior position after White's
                immediate 3.f3
                with 3...e5!. In 1889, Ignatz von Popiel came up with the idea of 3.Nc3, though his
                main
                idea was to meet 3...Nf6 with 4.Bg5 (rather than the more usual 4.f3) and provided
                analysis
                of the
                <b>Lemberger Counter-Gambit</b>
                (3.Nc3 e5).
            </p>
            <p>The evolved, modern form of this gambit owes much to the German master
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Josef_Diemer" title="Emil Josef Diemer">
                    Emil Josef Diemer
                </a>
                (1908–90), who popularized the continuation 3.Nc3 Nf6 and then 4.f3 (when 4...e5? is
                ineffective as 5.dxe5 hits Black's knight, and after 5...Qxd1+ 6.Kxd1 the knight has
                to
                retreat to d7 or g8). The position resulting after 3... Nf6 4.f3 reflects the main
                line of
                the gambit accepted, although other Black responses on move three are possible.
                After many
                years of analysis, Diemer wrote a book on the opening in the late 1950s, titled
                <i>Vom Ersten Zug An Auf Matt!</i>
                (<i>Toward Mate From The First Move!</i>), with most of the published analysis
                devoted to
                the
                <b>Ryder Gambit</b>

                of much
                debate both on and off the chessboard. The ChessOK Opening Tree Mode lists the
                Blackmar–Diemer as scoring 49% wins for White, 34% wins for Black, and 17% draws.

                Dismissed by many masters on the one hand, and embraced enthusiastically by many
                amateurs on
                the other, many consider that Black has good chances of defending successfully and
                converting the extra pawn in the<a

                the tendency for some Blackmar–Diemer fanatics to try to get the opening in every
                game, thus
                limiting their chess experience, and concluded, "Nobody who plays good chess plays

                played
                at the top level. It experiences a lower percentage of

            <p>After 3.dxe5 Black can try the
                <i>Fajarowicz variation</i>
                3...Ne4 which concentrates on the rapid development of the pieces, but the most
                common move
                is 3...Ng4 with three main possibilities for White. The
                <i>Adler variation</i>
                4.Nf3 sees White seeking a

                4.e4 gives White an important spatial advantage and a strong<a

                The

                4.Bf4 leads to an important choice for White, after 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+, between
                6.Nbd2 and
                6.Nc3. The reply 6.Nbd2 brings a positional game in which White enjoys the

                    title="Glossary of chess">pawn
                    structure</a>. Black usually looks to have an aggressive game (many lines of
                which can
                shock opponents that do not know the theory) or cripple white's pawn structure.

                </a>
                themes. After 3.dxe5 Ng4, there is a battle over White's extra pawn on e5, which
                Black
                typically attacks with ...Nc6 and (after ...Bc5 or ...Bb4+) ...Qe7, while White
                often
                defends it with Bf4, Nf3, and sometimes Qd5. In the 4.Nf3 variation the game can
                evolve
                either with Black attacking White's

                which case
                Black reacts in the centre against the e3-pawn. In numerous variations the move
                c4–c5 allows
                White to gain space and to open prospects for his<a

                play for
                the black pieces, and White making the typical mistake of moving the queen too
                early. As the
                player of the white pieces was not a strong player, the new opening went unnoticed
                apart

                Meanwhile, more positional plans were also developed for White. Rubinstein showed
                how White
                could get a small positional advantage with 4.Bf4 Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2, an
                assessment still
                valid today. The possibility 6.Nc3 was also considered attractive, as structural
                weaknesses
                were not valued as much as a material advantage of one pawn in those days. By the
                end of the
                1920s, despite the invention of the highly original

            <p>This assessment was left unchanged for decades, as few players at the highest level
                used the
                Budapest Gambit and information about games from lesser players could not easily be
                found.
                During that time, various responses were developed against the 4.Bf4 line; these
                included
                4...g5, invented by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istv%C3%A1n_Abonyi"

                showed that even when White succeeded in his positional plan, it only meant for
                Black a
                worse endgame with drawish tendencies.

            <p>The Italian Game is white’s effort to quickly develop his light square bishop and
                dominate
                the center of the board. The Calabrese Countergambit is black’s way of giving up his
                f-pawn
                to completely thwart all of white’s game plan. The more aggressive white tries to be
                in the
                opening the more potential traps he can fall into.
            </p>
            <p>Black usually ends up with a very strong center while white’s pieces struggle to find
                great
                squares to develop. White must play very precise or he can easily find himself in a
                lot of
                trouble.
            </p>
            <p>If you like to attack as the black pieces then the Calabrese Countergambit is
                definitely
                something you should try out.
