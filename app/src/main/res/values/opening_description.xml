     Jonas, basicamente temos 5 string-arrays para alimentar cada atributo:
        private String name;            - alimentado por <string-array name="openings_names">
        private String history;         - alimentado por <string-array name="openings_history">
        private String description;     - alimentado por <string-array name="openings_description">
        private String imageUrl;        - alimentado por <string-array name="openings_image_url">
        private String youtubeId;       - alimentado por <string-array name="openings_youtube_id">

         A unica questao é que TODAS os string-array deverão ter o mesmo numero de item's, para funcionar bem.
         Se achares demasiado confuso até pudemos colcar cada string-array num ficheiro diferente.

            <p>The Sicilian is the most popular and best-scoring response to White\'s first move
                1.e4. 1.d4 is a statistically more successful opening for white due to the high
                success rate of the Sicilian defence against 1.e4.

                attributes the Sicilian Defence\'s popularity to "its combative nature; in many lines
                Black is playing not just for equality, but for the advantage. The drawback is that
                White often obtains an early initiative, so Black has to take care not to fall
                victim to a quick attack."

                considered why the Sicilian is the most successful response to 1.e4, even though
                1...c5 develops no pieces, and the pawn on c5 controls only d4 and b4. Rowson
                writes:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="templatequote">
                <p>To my mind there is quite a straightforward explanation. In order to profit from
                    the initiative granted by the first move, White has to make use of his
                    opportunity to do something before Black has an equal number of opportunities of
                    his own. However, to do this, he has to make \'contact\' with the black position.
                    The first point of contact usually comes in the form of a pawn exchange, which
                    leads to the opening of the position. … So the thought behind 1...c5 is this:
                    ″OK, I\'ll let you open the position, and develop your pieces aggressively, but
                    at a price – you have to give me one of your center pawns.″
