                considered why the Sicilian is the most successful response to 1.e4, even though
                1...c5 develops no pieces, and the pawn on c5 controls only d4 and b4. Rowson
                writes:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="templatequote">
                <p>To my mind there is quite a straightforward explanation. In order to profit from
                    the initiative granted by the first move, White has to make use of his
                    opportunity to do something before Black has an equal number of opportunities of
                    his own. However, to do this, he has to make 'contact' with the black position.
                    The first point of contact usually comes in the form of a pawn exchange, which
                    leads to the opening of the position. … So the thought behind 1...c5 is this:
                    ″OK, I'll let you open the position, and develop your pieces aggressively, but
                    at a price – you have to give me one of your center pawns.″

                tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn centre, with plans to undermine
                and attack
                the white structure later in the spirit of hypermodern defence. White's imposing
                mass of
                pawns in the centre often includes pawns on c4, d4, e5, and f4.

                obtains a move

                which case
                Black reacts in the centre against the e3-pawn. In numerous variations the move

             <p>The Italian Game is white’s effort to quickly develop his light square bishop and
                dominate
                the center of the board. The Calabrese Countergambit is black’s way of giving up his
                f-pawn
                to completely thwart all of white’s game plan. The more aggressive white tries to be
                in the
                opening the more potential traps he can fall into.
            </p>

                great
                squares to develop. White must play very precise or he can easily find himself in a
                lot of
                trouble.
