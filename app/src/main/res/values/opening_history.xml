		<p>The Blackmar–Diemer Gambit arose as a development of the earlier Blackmar Gambit,
                named after
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armand_Blackmar" title="Armand Blackmar">
                    Armand Blackmar</a>, a relatively
                little-known New Orleans player of the late 19th century who popularized its
                characteristic
                moves (1.d4 d5 2.e4 dxe4 3.f3) and was the first player to publish analysis on the
                opening
                in the chess literature.
                <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2">

                    </a>
                </sup>
                The popularity of the original Blackmar Gambit, however, was short-lived, as it was
                basically unsound, allowing Black to secure a superior position after White\'s
                immediate 3.f3
                with 3...e5!. In 1889, Ignatz von Popiel came up with the idea of 3.Nc3, though his
                main
                idea was to meet 3...Nf6 with 4.Bg5 (rather than the more usual 4.f3) and provided
                analysis
                of the
                <b>Lemberger Counter-Gambit</b>
                (3.Nc3 e5).
            </p>
            <p>The evolved, modern form of this gambit owes much to the German master
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Josef_Diemer" title="Emil Josef Diemer">
                    Emil Josef Diemer
                </a>
                (1908–90), who popularized the continuation 3.Nc3 Nf6 and then 4.f3 (when 4...e5? is
                ineffective as 5.dxe5 hits Black\'s knight, and after 5...Qxd1+ 6.Kxd1 the knight has
                to
                retreat to d7 or g8). The position resulting after 3... Nf6 4.f3 reflects the main
                line of
                the gambit accepted, although other Black responses on move three are possible.
                After many
                years of analysis, Diemer wrote a book on the opening in the late 1950s, titled
                <i>Vom Ersten Zug An Auf Matt!</i>
                (<i>Toward Mate From The First Move!</i>), with most of the published analysis
                devoted to
                the
                <b>Ryder Gambit</b>

                of much
                debate both on and off the chessboard. The ChessOK Opening Tree Mode lists the
                Blackmar–Diemer as scoring 49% wins for White, 34% wins for Black, and 17% draws.

                Dismissed by many masters on the one hand, and embraced enthusiastically by many
                amateurs on
                the other, many consider that Black has good chances of defending successfully and
                converting the extra pawn in the<a

                "Stop playing for the endgame, play to end the game! Be a winner. Play the

                On the other hand, Sam Collins (in his book<i>Understanding the Chess Openings</i>)
                noted
                the tendency for some Blackmar–Diemer fanatics to try to get the opening in every
                game, thus
                limiting their chess experience, and concluded, "Nobody who plays good chess plays
                this

                play for
                the black pieces, and White making the typical mistake of moving the queen too
                early. As the
                player of the white pieces was not a strong player, the new opening went unnoticed
                apart

                Meanwhile, more positional plans were also developed for White. Rubinstein showed
                how White
                could get a small positional advantage with 4.Bf4 Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2, an
                assessment still
                valid today. The possibility 6.Nc3 was also considered attractive, as structural
                weaknesses
                were not valued as much as a material advantage of one pawn in those days. By the
                end of the
                1920s, despite the invention of the highly original

            </p>
            <p>This assessment was left unchanged for decades, as few players at the highest level
                used the
                Budapest Gambit and information about games from lesser players could not easily be
                found.
                During that time, various responses were developed against the 4.Bf4 line; these
                included
                4...g5, invented by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istv%C3%A1n_Abonyi"

                showed that even when White succeeded in his positional plan, it only meant for
                Black a
                worse endgame with drawish tendencies.

For a long time, it was the third most popular reply to 1.e4, behind only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Sicilian_Defence" title="Sicilian Defence">1...c5</a> and 1...e5. However, according to the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.chessbase.com/shop/product.asp?pid=255">Mega Database 2007</a>, in 2006, 1...e6 was second only to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Sicilian_Defence" title="Sicilian Defence">Sicilian</a> in popularity.</p>
            <p>Historically important contributors to the theory of the defence include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Mikhail_Botvinnik" title="Mikhail Botvinnik">Mikhail Botvinnik</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Viktor_Korchnoi" title="Viktor Korchnoi">Viktor Korchnoi</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Aron_Nimzowitsch" title="Aron Nimzowitsch">Aron Nimzowitsch</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Tigran_Petrosian" title="Tigran Petrosian">Tigran Petrosian</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Lev_Psakhis" title="Lev Psakhis">Lev Psakhis</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Wolfgang_Uhlmann" title="Wolfgang Uhlmann">Wolfgang Uhlmann</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Rafael_Vaganian" title="Rafael Vaganian">Rafael Vaganian</a>. More recently, its leading practitioners include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Evgeny_Bareev" title="Evgeny Bareev">Evgeny Bareev</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Alexey_Dreev" title="Alexey Dreev">Alexey Dreev</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Mikhail_Gurevich_(chess_player)" title="Mikhail Gurevich (chess player)">Mikhail Gurevich</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Alexander_Khalifman" title="Alexander Khalifman">Alexander Khalifman</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Smbat_Lputian" title="Smbat Lputian">Smbat Lputian</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Alexander_Morozevich" title="Alexander Morozevich">Alexander Morozevich</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Teimour_Radjabov" title="Teimour Radjabov">Teimour Radjabov</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Nigel_Short" title="Nigel Short">Nigel Short</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Gata_Kamsky" title="Gata Kamsky">Gata Kamsky</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Yury_Shulman" title="Yury Shulman">Yury Shulman</a>.</p>
            <p>The <b>Exchange Variation</b> was recommended by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Howard_Staunton" title="Howard Staunton">Howard Staunton</a> in the 19th century,<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> but has been in decline ever since. In the early 1990s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Garry_Kasparov" title="Garry Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a> briefly experimented with it before switching to 3.Nc3. Note that Black\'s game is made much easier as his queen\'s bishop has been liberated. It has the reputation of giving immediate equality to Black, due to the symmetrical pawn structure.</p>
            <p>Like the Exchange, the <b>Advance Variation</b> was frequently played in the early days of the French Defence. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Aron_Nimzowitsch" title="Aron Nimzowitsch">Aron Nimzowitsch</a> believed it to be White\'s best choice and enriched its theory with many ideas. However, the Advance declined in popularity throughout most of the 20th century until it was revived in the 1980s by GM and prominent opening theoretician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Evgeny_Sveshnikov" title="Evgeny Sveshnikov">Evgeny Sveshnikov</a>, who continues to be a leading expert in this line. In recent years, it has become nearly as popular as 3.Nd2; GM <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Alexander_Grischuk" title="Alexander Grischuk">Alexander Grischuk</a> has championed it successfully at the highest levels. It is also a popular choice at the club level due to the availability of a simple, straightforward plan involving attacking chances and extra space.</p>
