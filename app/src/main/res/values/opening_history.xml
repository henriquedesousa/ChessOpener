            irregular defences to 1.P-K4 at Black\'s disposal, and has been practised with
            satisfactory results by the leading players of the day."

            In this period Black\'s approach was usually slow and positional, and the all-out attacks
            by White that became common after World War II had not yet been developed.

                up
                control of the centre, neglects his development, and often submits to horribly
                cramped
                positions. How can it be good? Yet, the brilliant wins by White are matched by
                equally
                brilliant wins by Black; time and again the Black structure has been able to take
                everything and come back for more."

                chances against 1.e4. Both players favoured sharp, aggressive play and employed the
                Sicilian almost exclusively throughout their careers, burnishing the defence\'s

                It

                tempts White\'s pawns forward to form a broad pawn centre, with plans to undermine
                and attack the white structure later in the spirit of hypermodern defence. White\'s
                imposing mass of pawns in the centre often includes pawns on c4, d4, e5, and f4.

                observes of Alekhine\'s in MCO-15 (2008), "The game immediately loses any sense of
                symmetry or balance, which makes the opening a good choice for aggressive fighting
                players."
